# atlanta-npu

Collection of code and documentation related to Atlanta's Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) system

This repo contains some Atlanta NPU-wide info, and anything specific to a particular NPU will live in a folder titled "npu-#" (e.g. `/npu-o`)

I'm not associated with City of Atlanta, but looking to collaborate with people working with city & regional government.  Recommend checking out Kip Dunlap's work with ATL Dept of City Planning: https://github.com/search?q=owner%3AUrbaneD0ge+npu&type=repositories

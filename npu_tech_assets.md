# NPU Tech Assets

Taken from [NPU Best Practices](https://www.npuatlanta.org/npubestpractices) (2023 Edition)

Below is a list of Entities, from the best practices report.  Capturing this list since these are the items that NPU tech tools will work with.  As we build automation and templates, we can tie them back to this list, so we have a lexicon of terms & items to use.
